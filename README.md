# Gesture_Recognition
### Problem statement: 
A home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions wants you to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

* Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
* Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
* Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
* Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
* Stop: Pause the movie



### Understanding the Dataset:
The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.
